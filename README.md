# 🎉 Late New Year Countdown

This project creates a New Year countdown based on your public IP address. It uses two APIs: one to find the public IP and another to get real-time data based on the IP, then displays a countdown to the New Year.

⚠️ **Work in Progress**: The project is in development, and future improvements will be made to optimize and enhance the functionality.

## ✨ Features
- Displays a countdown to the New Year.
- Fetches real-time data based on public IP using APIs.

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Optimize performance and responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
Upload the code to your ESP8266 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
